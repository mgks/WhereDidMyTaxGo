A small, open-source, single-page web app that shows how a government budget translates into **per-person tax spending**. You enter your *country* and *yearly income*. No login or personal information required. You stay complete anonymous.
  
It shows, visually and simply, how your tax is split across things like defence, healthcare, infrastructure, welfare, and more.
No charts for economists. No jargon.

Just simple numbers people can actually understand in a fun way.

## Why this exists

Every budget announcement talks in trillions and percentages.
That means nothing to most people.

This project flips the question:

> Instead of “How much did the government spend?”  

> **What did *MY* tax actually pay for?**

## What it does (right now)

- Salary → estimated tax contribution
- Budget allocation → per-person breakdown
- Simple visuals (bars, levels, achievements-style stats)
- Fast, client-side only
- No tracking, no accounts, no backend

## Tech stack

- Node.js
- Minimal server (for routing, data handling, builds)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript on the frontend
- Designed to stay simple and hackable

This is intentionally **not** a heavy app or SaaS.
It’s a viral, educational one-pager with room to evolve.

## Data

Budget allocations are based on publicly available government budget documents.
Numbers are approximate and meant for **education and awareness**, not accounting or legal use.

Sources are linked directly in the UI where possible.

## Privacy

* This tool is designed with privacy as a core principle. 100% open source.
* All processing happens locally in your web browser.
* Your information is never uploaded to any external server.
* We use optional, anonymous Google Analytics to understand feature usage (e.g., which conversion paths are most popular) to improve the tool.
* No login or personal data or any private information is ever collected.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially:
- Adding new countries
- Improving budget mappings
- Translations
- UI improvements that keep things simple
